      The “Class” system for Mercedes only came about in 1972 with the arrival of their W116 car, which they created the S-Class for. The S-Class was launched in order to introduce a series of flagship cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1994, the manufacturer changed the nomenclature of their cars, so a model would be named by a letter, and followed by up to three digits.

      This alphanumerical system was to categorise the cars better. The old system saw the letter represent the class it belonged to, and the numbers represented the engine’s displacement in litres multiplied by 100. This would the follow a suffix of letters, which indicated body style and engine type.</p>
